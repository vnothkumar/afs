## Overview

The Advanced Filesystem (AFS) addresses modern data storage challenges by providing unique solutions that enhance data integrity, accessibility, and lifecycle management. Built for scalability and flexibility, AFS is suitable for a variety of environments.

### Key Features

- **Adaptive Data Caching**: Utilizes real-time analytics to optimize caching strategies based on current workload patterns, prioritizing frequently accessed data for improved performance.

- **Distributed Metadata Management**: Separates metadata handling from data storage, enabling distributed management of metadata across nodes to enhance scalability and reduce bottlenecks.

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Offers built-in end-to-end encryption with user-controlled keys, ensuring maximum privacy and security for stored data.

- **Smart Quota Management**: Implements intelligent quota management that dynamically adjusts user quotas based on activity and data growth, optimizing resource allocation.

- **Temporal File System**: Allows users to create temporary files that automatically expire after a predefined period, ensuring data does not linger longer than necessary.

- **Blockchain-Backed Version Control**: Implements version control using blockchain technology to maintain an immutable history of file changes, providing robust auditing capabilities.

- **Context-Aware Storage**: Adjusts filesystem behavior based on contextual information (e.g., user location, device type) to optimize performance and security.

- **Dynamic Redundancy Management**: Dynamically adjusts redundancy levels based on data criticality and access frequency, balancing performance and reliability.
